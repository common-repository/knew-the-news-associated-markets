Easily associate and integrate markets from the news prediction site Knew The News in your blog posts.

== Description ==

Using this plugin, you can freely integrate widgets from Knew The News predictions into your own blog posts. You may simply add their title, but also display the evolution graph, or the chart which show the current opinion of the Knew The News users.

You select and position these references completely without the need to leave your blog administation using the provided search dialog of the plugin.

Additionally, the plugin offers you the opportunity to remotely create markets on Knew The News which in turn may be used in your blog post (a user account on Knew The News is needed for this). Again: Without the need to leave your blog.

Knew The News will recognize the usage of the market widgets in your blog post and will display links directing to it. These additional links will drive some traffic to your blog, and will increase your page rank.
